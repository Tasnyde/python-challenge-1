## Project Description
The overall intent is for python education, training and learning. The focus of the project was to design an

which helpded guide the studen through next steps needed to complete the code. 
The final output allows customerss to place an order, which includes storing the customer's order and printing 
the receipt with the total price of all items ordered.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

## Testing

Basic testing was used in Visual Studio Code.

The final output was tested for proper functionality. 
The food truck customer was asked for their order from a menu, with several options available. 
They can continue through the loop adding addtional items until they order everything they want.
They than have the option to stop ordering and a final receipt with all there selections,
